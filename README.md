# Spotify-Playlist-Generator
Spotify Playlist Generator is used to create a curated playlist for a user based on their listening habits and saved playlists(public playlists), which is retrieved using Spotify APIs. Based on the repetition of songs in the ser's playlists  and their popularity, we can generate a playlist which the user can identify as favorite and "go-to" songs.
